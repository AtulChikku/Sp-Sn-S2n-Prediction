## üéØ Motivation & Goal
- **What is the problem?** 
- **Why is it important?** (e.g., "Manual searches are impossible; automated ML methods can flag potential discoveries for further investigation.")
- **What is the goal of this project?** (e.g., "To develop and evaluate an autoencoder-based deep learning model for unsupervised anomaly detection on the LHC Olympics 2020 dataset.")

## üíæ Dataset
- Describe the dataset you used.
- Provide a link to the source (e.g., the official LHC Olympics page).
- Explain the key features of the data (e.g., "Each event is characterized by the momenta of up to 700 constituent particles.").

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
- Briefly explain the approach you took.
- Mention the key algorithms and models used. For example, for the anomaly detection project, you would mention using a **Deep Autoencoder**. For the nuclear energy project, you might mention using a **Feedforward Neural Network (ANN)** for regression.
- Describe your evaluation metric (e.g., "Anomaly score is defined by the model's reconstruction error. Performance is evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).")

## üìä Results
- Showcase your key findings here. This is the most impressive part!
- Include your most important plots (e.g., the reconstruction error distribution, the ROC curve). You can embed images directly in the README.
- State your final metrics clearly (e.g., "The final model achieved an AUC of 0.92 on the test set.").
